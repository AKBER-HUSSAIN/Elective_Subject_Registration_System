## Branch-wise Access Control
- Each admin can only access data for their specific branch
- Students uploaded by an admin will be assigned to that admin's branch
- Electives created by an admin will be associated with that admin's branch
- Reports generated will only include data from the admin's branch

## Notes
- All admin accounts are created automatically when the server starts
- If an admin account already exists for a branch, it won't be recreated
- The system ensures complete branch isolation for data security
